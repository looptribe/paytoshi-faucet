Faucet Script for [Paytoshi](https://paytoshi.org): the Bitcoin micropayment wallet. It integrates the [Paytoshi API library](https://github.com/looptribe/paytoshi-library-php) with the faucet frontend and the admin area.

Create a Paytoshi account, get an apikey and start using your Bitcoin faucet website.

Based on [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) and [Twig](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig).

## Upgrade from Paytoshi Faucet Script v1
The new version should be mostly compatible with your faucet installation.

Before attempting an upgrade always backup your database and installation folder first.

Be aware that we changed our theming support so if you customized the files under the `themes` directory you may need to redo your changes on the new files. In any other case just download the faucet zip and extract it on top of your existing installation.
